				<h3>Nominations</h3>
				<p>Candidates usually receive a nomination from someone in Congress, usually their House Representative, two Senators, or the Vice-President. To receive a nomination, most nominating sources require essays, schooling transcripts, standardized testing scores, and an interview. There are other nominating sources as well. Anyone living outside the United States may be nominated by the US Embassy in their country. There are nominating sources for currently enlisted airmen and children of Air Force soldiers. For children of Medal of Honor recipients, admissions is guaranteed so long as the candidate meets all of the requirements.</p>

				<h3>Cadet Life</h3>
				<p>Each year during the summer, usually in early July, cadets participate in summer programs. Their first year, it's Cadet Basic Training. After that, it's up to the cadet to decide which of the summer activities they want to participate in. Their fourth year, they have the opportunity to be an instructor in basic training for new cadets. Cadets wake up early, around 5:30, and do duties or workout. Then they go to class, then eat lunch, then back to class. After that, they go to their sport or physical education class. Then they have dinner, and after that they have free time, which they usually use to study or do schoolwork.</p>

				<h3>Admission</h3>
				<p>The USAFA looks at 3 main areas in determining who to admit. The first area is leadership. The USAFA wants people who are leaders in school, sports, and their community. Being a part of organizations like Scouts, National Honor Society, 4-H, school and club sports, Civil Air Patrol, and any other activity you can participate in, especially those that you can hold a leadership position in. The second is academics. While the minimum score on the ACT to enter the Academy is a 24 composite, the USAFA wants around a 30 composite. They also want candidates to be in the top of their class and have a good GPA. The third is athletics. They use a fitness test for this, but also like to see that a candidate plays sports. The fitness test consists of a basketball throw, pull-ups or flexed arm hang, shuttle run, sit-ups, push-ups, and a one-mile run, which all have to be completed in 35 minutes. The Academy also requires a nomination from someone in Congress or various other nominating sources. Letters of recommendation are also required. 3 letters from 11th or 12th grade teachers are required, 1 being from an English teacher and another from a Math teacher, with the 3rd being from a teacher of the candidate's choice. 2 letters from community members are optional.</p>
