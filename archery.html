				<h2>Hunting Deer with Archery Equipment</h2>
				<p>Hunting Deer with a crossbow or recurve bow is fairly common. If you wish to hunt a deer, it is best to sit in a treestand and wait. Pick a spot in the woods that has a large opening that would allow you to shoot without your arrow hitting anything. It is best to leave salt blocks and corn in a place that you would like to shoot the deer. This way they think of where you want to shoot them as a place that they should go frequently. Make sure to practice shooting a lot so you can kill the deer quickly.</p>

				<h2>Turkey Hunting with Archery Equipment</h2>
				<p>Turkey hunting with a bow can be perfect for bringing home Thanksgiving dinner. Turkeys usually perch up in trees. If you find a tree full of turkeys and you're a good shoot, then that may be how you bag your turkey. If you don't find a turkey tree, it would probably be best to look in fields. Fields are where most turkeys are bagged, and that is where you will probably get yours. When you shoot a turkey, aim for the neck. Special arrow tips are made for turkey hunting, and are designed to decapitate them.
