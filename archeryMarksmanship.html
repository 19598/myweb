				<h2>Types of Bows</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Longbow - This type of bow is usually wood, and it doesn't have any mechanical parts. It is just one piece of wood with some string.</li>
					<li>Recurve -  This type of bow is also usually wood, but instead of being almost a semicircle, its limbs have curves in them.</li>
					<li>Compound - These bows are not wood, and they have pulleys that make up for their lack of height. They are the most common, and are what people usually use for hunting.</li>
					<li>Crossbow - These bows are very different from what is usually thought of as a bow. They are almost like the body of a gun along with it's trigger, but with a bow on top to fire the arrow.</li>

				<h2>Archery Marksmanship</h2>
				<p>Archery is a much cheaper sport to get into than shooting firearms. Once you purchase your original materials, you may only need to buy new target faces on occasion. Shooting archery can be rewarding, but also difficult.</p>

				<h2>Consistency</h2>
				<p>The most important thing is to be consistent. All these tips really do is to help you shoot more consistently. As long as you have tight groups, you can adjust your sights and your aim to put the arrow where you want it to go. As long as you do the same thing every time, you can shoot in unorthodox ways.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Aiming</h2>
				<p>Depending on your bow, you may or may not have a sight. If you don't have a sight, it is recommended to use the tip of your arrow as a sight. If you do, then make sure you line up your sights the same way every time.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Anchor</h2>
				<p>When you draw the string back, the place that you rest your nock (the part of the arrow that connects to the string) is your anchor point. The most important thing is that this stays the same. Most people with compound bows can only pull back to a certain distance, but if you don't have a compound bow or the draw length is too long, then rest it in the corner of your lip.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Release</h2>
				<p>How you release your arrow is key to being consistent. If you shoot a compound bow, you can usually get a trigger that allows you to release incredibly consistently. If you draw the string back with your fingers, try to keep your hand in the same spot when you release. Many people have a habit of letting their hand fall forward or jerk back when they release, and it causes inconsistency.</p>
