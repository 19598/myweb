				<h2>Sharpshooting</h2>
				<p>If you are hunting coyotes, feral hogs, or small game, then you will probably be using some type of firearm. It is important to be accurate so you don't let the animal get away, or even worse, injure but not kill it. While buying expensive equipment is necessary to shoot tighter groups and farther away, it does not make you a better shooter. Follow these tips to become better at shooting accurately.</p>

				<h2>Consistency</h2>
				<p>The most important thing is to be consistent. All these tips really do is to help you shoot more consistently. As long as you have tight groups, you can adjust your sights and your aim to put the bullet where you want it to go. As long as you do the same thing every time, you can shoot in unorthpdox ways.</p>

				<h2>Sight Picture</h2>
				<p>This is most important if you are shooting with iron sights, but does apply elsewhere. You should align the top of the rear sight with the top of the front sight, and have the front sight in the center of the rear sight. If you are shooting with a scope, then make sure you have the same eye relief every time, and the reticle is in the same spot every time.</p>

				<h2>Trigger Control</h2>
				<p>Many people say that you should be surprised when you pull the trigger. That is idiotic, because this may cause people to jump. You should pull back slowly on the trigger, and know exactly when you are going to shoot. Don't jerk the trigger, as this could move your gun. Just pull back slowly, and know when the gun is going to shoot.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Flinching</h2>
				<p>Some people may notice that they are flinching. A good way to test if you are flinching is to have someone else load your magazine, and have them randomly insert spent cartridges. If the gun moves when you attempt to shoot a spent cartridge, you are flinching. To fix this, continue this excersize. You can also shoot a blank every other shot.</p>

				<h2>Breathing</h2>
				<p>When you are shooting, it is important to not breath. Breathing changes your sight picture. Instead take a deep breath in, or completely exhale. This will help reduce motion.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Reducing Sway</h2>
				<p>It's hard to hit a target when your sights keep moving. To reduce barrel sway, anchor yourself on as many things as possible. Put your elbow on your hip, or knee, or on the ground. Rest the gun against a tree, or use a bipod. Gaining strength can help reduce sway aswell. If you notice that you are almost perfectly still except for a periodic little sway, don't worry. This is your heartbeat. Just try to relax, and shoot between heartbeats. It helps if you lower your resting heartbeat by doing cardio.</p>
